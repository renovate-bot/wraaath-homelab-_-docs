# üìñ Docs
This is the documentation for some of the non-docker things running in my homelab. \
A work in progress.

Head over to [wraaath-homelab/docker-services](https://github.com/wraaath-homelab/docker-services) and read the `service/README.md` for the documentation in my specifik docker services.

## Problems?

* Consult the official project's page.

* Submit a [PR](https://github.com/wraaath-homelab/docker-services/pulls) or an [Issue](https://github.com/wraaath-homelab/docker-services/issues) on the repo. And I'll try to help.
