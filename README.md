# üìñ Docs
This is the documentation and guides for some of the non-docker things running in my homelab. \
A work in progress.

Head over to [wraaath-homelab/docker-services](https://github.com/wraaath-homelab/docker-services) and read the `service/README.md` for the documentation in my specifik docker services.
